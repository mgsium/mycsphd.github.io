## Why this site?

We created the site because we find that

1.  The process and implications of getting a Ph.D. vary widely across
    disciplines (e.g., computer science vs. biology vs. history), so
    information specifically about CS is necessary to make a good decision.

2.  High-quality information about getting a Ph.D. in computer science can be 
    difficult to find, often incorrect, or specific to particular
    Ph.D. programs.
	
3.  Anecdotal evidence suggested that undergraduates at all kinds of schools
    harbor basic misunderstandings about getting a Ph.D. including how to pay
    for it and what research (the focus of a Ph.D.) entails.

4.  Undergraduates often do not have access to advisors that can provide accurate,
    first-hand information about getting a Ph.D. in computer science.
	
5.  We suspect that this lack of ready access to good information is a barrier
    to entry to Ph.D. programs for many different groups.

We aim to provide high-quality information directly from people with
first-hand, current, day-to-day knowledge how Ph.D. programs work and why you
might or might not what to get a Ph.D.
